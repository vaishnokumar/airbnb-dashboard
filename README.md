**Problem Statement:**

In the context of Airbnb operations, how can the utilisation of Tableau Desktop/Tableau Public/PowerBI facilitate a comprehensive comparative examination between Chicago and New Orleans, two diverse urban environments?

This inquiry seeks to leverage Tableau Desktop/Tableau Public/PowerBI's visual analytics capabilities to uncover and illustrate the shared attributes, disparities, and distinctive patterns inherent to Airbnb's presence in these cities, thus elevating the depth and insightfulness of the study.

**Dataset Selection:**

For this EDA project, we have chosen the "Airbnb Listings Data" dataset from 2 major cities: Chicago and New Orleans. This dataset provides a comprehensive snapshot of various attributes related to Airbnb listings, such as property type, neighbourhood, pricing, availability, and more. The dataset is ideal for conducting an in-depth exploration of the local Airbnb market and deriving actionable insights.

**Why Airbnb:**

Airbnb, a prominent online platform, enables individuals to reserve accommodations spanning a spectrum from beds and rooms to apartments and entire homes across global locales. This user-centric platform serves as a conduit for seamless property rentals, negating the need for intricate intermediaries or substantial capital outlays. Notably, users can secure lodgings at significantly competitive rates relative to traditional hotels. Distinctively, Airbnb extends its reach to regions where convectional hotel presence might be limited, offering an avenue for lodging acquisition in underserved locales. Moreover, the inclination towards immersive local experiences often steers individuals towards selecting accommodations embedded within native communities, fostering a distinctive preference for authenticity and cultural engagement.
